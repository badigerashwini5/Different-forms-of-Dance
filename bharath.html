	<h3>Origin</h3>
		<p align="justify">Bharatanatyam, according to Balasaraswati, is a variety of natya yoga that reveals the spiritual through the physical and emotional body. It is the most popular of the Indian classical dance forms in South India, and the most ancient of all the classical Indian dance styles in the entire India, which are all based on Natya Shastra, the Bible of the classical Indian dance. The term "Bharatanatyam" was used by Purandara Dasa (1484-1564). Later, Ghanam Krishnayyar's songs describes a devadasi as an expert at Bharata natyam. Subramania Bharathi also speaks about Bharatnatyam.

	<h3>The legend and the inspiration</h3>
		<p align="justify">Bharatanatyam has a divine origin. Devas asked Brahma to create a Veda that would be understood by the Sudras, as Kali Yuga was nearing: "When the universe was overcome by desire, greed, jealousy and anger, when people became slaves of pleasure and pain,  Brahma was moved to create a form of entertainment seen and heard and understood by everybody at the same time, as people could no longer understand the mystic and ambiguous scriptures".
			Bharata natyam was created "not merely for pleasure, but to embody the cosmic relationships and expressions (bhava) for all the worlds. So this performing art follows the worlds' movements in all activities and states: work and leisure, calm and laughter, fight and wars. It will confer righteousness onto the righteous, a moral restraint for the unruly, and discipline for the those who are guided by rule. It will teach wisdom both to the ignorant and the learned. It will provide entertainment for kings, and it will console the miserable ones. Natya will express all the moods and passions of the soul. It will incorporate all kinds of the deeds: the noble, the mediocre and the mean"
			Bharatanatyam consists of three major aspects: Natya, Nritta and Nritya.The rhythmical and repetitive elements are called Nritta, i.e. it is dance proper.
			The dramatic art of expression in gestures, poses and mime is called Natya. cf. Abhinaya The combination of Nritta and Natya is called Nritya.</p>
